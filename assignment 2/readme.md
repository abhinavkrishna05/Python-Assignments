The Gradebook Analyser is a simple Python-based CLI tool that helps analyze student marks and generate useful statistics. It supports both manual data entry and CSV file import, making it convenient for teachers and students.

The program calculates important metrics such as average marks, median, highest score, and lowest score. It also assigns letter grades (A–F) based on score ranges and provides a clear summary of grade distribution, along with lists of passed and failed students.

The tool is easy to run in any Python environment and produces a clean, readable summary of all student performance data.
